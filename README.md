Sure, let's talk about the problems I encountered when using the isValidDate() method in my Date-Java project.

Main challenges:
Taking into account leap years. This was probably the hardest part. 
I had to correctly determine whether a year is a leap year in order to handle February correctly.
I had to take into account that a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.
Sometimes I got confused in the logical conditions, and this led to errors.

Different number of days in months:
I had to take into account that some months have 30 days, others have 31, and February has 28 or 29.
I used conditionals to check which month and how many days it has, and this made the code quite cumbersome.

Handling invalid values:
I had to consider that the user could enter invalid values ​​for the day, month or year (for example, negative numbers or values ​​that are too large).
I had to add checks to filter out such values ​​and return false.

Complexity of logic:
Overall, the logic of the isValidDate() method turned out to be quite complex due to the many conditions.
I spent a lot of time debugging to make sure that the method works correctly in all cases.

How I solved the problems:
I thoroughly tested the method with different values, including edge cases (for example, February 29 in a leap year and a non-leap year).
I broke the complex logic into smaller blocks to make the code more readable and understandable.
I used resources on the Internet to more accurately understand how the calendar works.
Despite these difficulties, I was able to implement the isValidDate() method, which correctly checks the validity of dates
